                <h3>5-2: The Betrayal...</h3>
                <p class="blog-preview">
                    In a game that defied the laws of basic human coordination, The Cabbeez fell to a 5-2 defeat. However, the scoreboard fails to mention that our two goals were "absolute screamers" while the oppositions five goals were "lucky" and "mathematically improbable."
                <br><br>
                The Gaffa has declined to attend tonight press conference. Instead he has decided to go down the pub and try to find the answers at the bottom of a pint.
                <br><br>
                <b>Club Statement:</b> "An official investigation is underway to determin if 'Jerome' is in breach of contract playing for the opposition team - Which directly resulted in tonights loss."

                <h3>0-6: A Tactical Masterclass in Surrender.</h3>
                <p class="blog-preview">
                    The board (the WhatsApp group) has met following Sunday's 6-0 obliteration. While most teams aim for a "clean sheet," the Gaffa decided to trial a "transparent defense" policy that saw the opposition score more often than our strikers touched the ball.
                    <br><br>
                    Rumours that the Gaffa’s pre-match tactical briefing consisted of "just run about a bit" and "don't let them score" have been confirmed. When asked for comment on the six goals conceded, the Manager blamed the gravitational pull of the Ely Cathedral and the fact that his favorite tracksuit was in the wash.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Club Statement:</b> "We have absolutely no confidence in the Gaffa's ability to drive the team home. His ability to manage a football team, however, has never been questioned. (Until now...)"
